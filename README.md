# TSNE_For_Non_ITs
Easy implementation of the TSNE algorithm as a Microsoft Excel Formula.

You can find an online 3D Barnes-Hut implementation in https://torrensjoaquin.github.io/TSNE/ .  
This is an OpenSource, client side, JS (with the help of P5js) implementation where you can paste your data directly from the spreadsheet.  
I'm not going to be able to see your information. Everything is happening in your computer.

TSNE wizard.
