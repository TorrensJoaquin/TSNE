## Online implementation of 3d Barnes-Hut TSNE, with your data.  

You can find an online 3D Barnes-Hut implementation in https://torrensjoaquin.github.io/TSNE/ .  
I think the "marketing" edition of TSNE, your first contact with the algorithm, should be the 3D edition.  
During an execution, the particles has to evade others and regroup with similar. Evading is easier on a higher dimensional world.  
Besides that, you can represent more structures due the curse of dimensionality.  
But... if you prefer the 2D. you can find it in https://torrensjoaquin.github.io/TSNE/twodversion .  
This is an OpenSource, client side, JS (with the help of P5js) implementation where you can paste your data directly from the spreadsheet.  
I'm not going to be able to see your information. Everything is happening on your computer.
